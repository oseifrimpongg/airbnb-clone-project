# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack web application that replicates key features of Airbnb, with a primary focus on backend systems. It is designed to provide hands-on experience in backend architecture, database design, API development, and application security, simulating a real-world software engineering environment.

## Project Goals

- Develop a scalable booking platform backend using modern technologies.
- Design and implement a relational database structure that mirrors real-world lodging and user interactions.
- Build secure, RESTful and GraphQL APIs.
- Integrate CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing, building, and deployment.
- Practice collaborative development workflows using GitHub and industry best practices.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework:** Django (Python)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **API Design:** REST & GraphQL
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Project Management:** GitHub Projects / Issues

## Key Features

- User Authentication and Authorization
- Property Listings and Bookings
- Search and Filter Functionality
- Payment Integration (planned)
- Admin Panel and User Roles
- API Rate Limiting and Security

> This repository is the foundation for a real-world clone project as inititated by ALx. Each stage of development will be documented with commits and supporting markdown files for clarity and collaboration.

## Team Roles

In a real-world software engineering environment, collaboration across specialised roles ensures product quality, timely delivery, and scalability. Below are the key roles involved in the Airbnb Clone project:

### Business Analyst
Gathers and defines business requirements from stakeholders, ensuring that the development team builds features aligned with user and business goals.

### Product Owner
Owns the product vision and roadmap. Prioritises features based on business value, manages the product backlog, and serves as the liaison between stakeholders and the development team.

### Project Manager
Oversees the project timeline, resource allocation, and team coordination. Ensures deliverables meet deadlines and communicates progress or blockers to stakeholders.

### UI/UX Designer
Designs user interfaces and experiences that are intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing. Converts business needs into design mockups, wireframes, and user flows.

### Software Architect
Defines the high-level structure of the application. Makes key decisions around system design, technology stack, and scalability to ensure technical alignment with business needs.

### Software Developer
- **Backend Developer:** Implements the core application logic, API endpoints, database interactions, and security protocols.
- **Frontend Developer:** (if applicable) Builds and integrates user-facing components based on UI/UX designs.

### Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
Tests the application manually to catch bugs, verify functionality, and ensure usability across different user scenarios.

### Test Automation Engineer
Writes automated test scripts to validate system behaviours continuously. Improves test coverage, efficiency, and regression prevention during deployments.

### DevOps Engineer
Sets up and maintains the CI/CD pipelines. Manages infrastructure, automates deployments, and ensures system stability in production and staging environments.

> Each role contributes uniquely to the success of the project. Clear communication and well-defined responsibilities foster collaboration and accelerate progress.

## Technology Stack

This project integrates several modern technologies to create a scalable, maintainable, and secure booking platform. Each technology serves a specific role in the architecture:

### Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. Handles routing, business logic, authentication, and ORM-based interactions with the database.

### MySQL
A relational database management system used to store and manage structured data such as user information, property listings, bookings, and payments.

### GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. Enhances flexibility and performance over traditional REST endpoints, especially in complex UIs.

### Docker
A containerisation platform that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated environments. Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production.

### Git & GitHub
Used for version control and team collaboration. GitHub hosts the repository, tracks issues, manages pull requests, and supports CI/CD through GitHub Actions.

### GitHub Actions
A CI/CD tool that automates testing, building, and deployment workflows. Ensures early detection of bugs and consistent delivery pipelines.

### REST (via Django REST Framework)
Provides standardised HTTP-based APIs for interacting with the application, particularly useful for mobile and third-party integrations.

### HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Planned Frontend)
Although this phase focuses on backend, the frontend will be powered by standard web technologies or a frontend framework, consuming the APIs built in Django/GraphQL.
